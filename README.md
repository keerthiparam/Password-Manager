# 🧹 Dust-Buster

**Dust-Buster** is a hardware prototype developed for the **Science Day Project Expo** at **R.M.D. Engineering College**. The project was created by a team of four first-year students — **Joshni, Kiruthika, Lakshmi, and Keerthi** — to address common classroom cleanliness issues using simple electronics and innovation.

Our idea began with designing a 3D-printed chalk box, inspired by the lack of them in our college. This evolved into an automated dust detection system aimed at contributing to **UN Sustainable Development Goal 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure**.

While we didn’t win the competition, we were proud to be one of the **finalist teams**.

## 🌱 Project Overview

The Dust-Buster detects dust or particles inside a chalk box using an ultrasonic sensor. If dust is detected within a certain range, it triggers an alert via a buzzer, signaling that cleaning is needed. This system encourages better maintenance of classroom resources and supports sustainability in everyday infrastructure.
